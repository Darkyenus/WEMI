# Things to do next

Naive smart caching: (cache reads: 24, cache writes: 105, key evaluations: 105)

1. Update to latest kotlin

1. Source code change detection and caching

1. Trace debug system for debugging keys (+ print current key trace on first Ctrl-T/C and java stack trace on second Ctrl-T with same key trace)

1. Allow to build IntelliJ plugins: https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin

1. New project wizard (IDE)

1. Allow projects to inherit from parent project configuration/config set
	- Maybe simple "setup function" would be enough...

1. Hotswapping jvm code

1. Android/MOE/RoboVM/TeaVM plugins

1. Kotlin JS

1. Kotlin Native
