# Things to do next

1. New project wizard

1. (Re)import build script by right-clicking it in the project view

1. Allow projects to inherit from parent project configuration/config set
	- Maybe simple "setup function" would be enough...

1. IDE (IntelliJ, other Jetbrains later) integrations

1. Allow to build IntelliJ plugins: https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin

1. Self hosting

1. Trace debug mode

1. Allow projects to depend on other projects and implement this in IDE plugin
